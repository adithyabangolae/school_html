        <p>Non hazardous waste is one of the two types of indurstial waste. It does not pose a direct threat to humans or the environment. This tpye of waste consists of plastic, glass, paper, ash, sludges, etc. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defines non-hazardous industrial waste as “waste generated from processes associated with the production of goods and products, such as electric power generation and manufacturing of materials such as pulp and paper, iron and steel, glass and concrete.” </p1>

        <div class="text_intro">
        <p>Non-hazardous waste is produced by industrial companies, especially companies that create solar panels. Generrally, Waste is generated by burning fossil fuels, such as coal ash, natural gas sludge, the byproducts of mining and mineral processing, and crude oil</p>

        <p>Effect of non-hazardous waste</p>

        <div class="text_intro">

        
        <p>Non hazardous wastes such as microplastics can significantly affect humans by causing damage to human cells, including both allergic reactions and cell death. Plastic consists of a number of chemical that are associated with health problems such as infertility and neurodevelopment disorders like ADHD and autism. Glass is not that harmful to humans but when its in pieces, then the sharp edges can seriously injure people.</p>
       
    </div>

    <div class="text_intro">
        <p>Plastic can release harmful chemicals into surrounding soil which can then go into groundwater or other surrounding water sources, and also the ecosystem. This can cause a range of harmful effects on the species that drink the water. Plastics are one of the main products of fracking which pollutes the water, soil and air, and also causes earthquakes. The major environmental impact of glass production is caused by atmospheric emissions from melting glass. The combustion of natural gas and the decomposition of raw materials during the melting lead to the emission of Carbon dioxide.</p>
